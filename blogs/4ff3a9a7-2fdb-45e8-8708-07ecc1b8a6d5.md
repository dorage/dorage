[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)

### 📝 문제

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
